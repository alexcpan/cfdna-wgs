RuleException in line 25 of /home/jeszyman/repos/mpnst-preprocessing/workflow/cappseq.smk:
NameError: The name 'print substr($0, 1, length($0)-21)' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}
